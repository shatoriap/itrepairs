<h1> Electronic Repairs (Computers, iPhones, iPads, and More) </h1><br>
  
<p>Repairing computers and phones is a hobby of mine that I've had since entering high school. Back in those days, I couldn't afford going to the local repair shops to get my electronics fixed, so I decided to teach myself how to fix them. Repairing electronics taught me the importance of patience and will to preservere, despite the difficulty of the repair. It still amazes me how those tiny screws, screens, and parts make up the devices we use on a daily basis. I salute all the repair technicians and companies that were made to create gifts with their hands and bring broken devices back to life. 
  
Here are a few repairs that I've done! I hope that you leave this page with curiosity and shock at how our electronics look on the inside and what it takes to fix them.</p>
